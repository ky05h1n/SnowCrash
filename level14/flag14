Level 14:

- File: getflag
- Language: C
- Permissions: -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root
- Behavior: it checks the  uid and then picks one of a bunch of encrypted strings, runs it through ft_des, and prints the token for that user

Vulnerability:

- reversing it with ghidra bypassing the preload-check exposed all the raw encrypted tokens
- using the logic of the ft_des decryption function


- Flag Token : 7QiHafiNa3HVozsaXkawuYrTstxbpABHD8CPnHJ
