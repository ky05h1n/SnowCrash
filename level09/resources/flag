Level09:
- Ran: `ls -l` → found a SUID binary `level09` and a file `token` readable only by `flag09`.
- Ran: `./level09 token` → output: `tpmhr`
- Ran: `./level09 abcdefg` → output: `acegikm`
- Observation: Each input character was shifted by its index (`a+0, b+1, c+2, ...`).
- Disassembled binary with Ghidra:
  - Main loop confirmed: `putchar(argv[1][i] + i)`
  - Logic: add index to each input character
- Conclusion: `token` was likely encoded using this same logic: `encoded[i] = original[i] + i`
- Exploit Identified: Decode `token` byte-by-byte by subtracting index: `original[i] = token[i] - i`
- Built a C program to apply `decoded[i] = token[i] - i`
- Output: `f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq`
- Warning: Using `cat` or `echo` to copy `token` corrupts non-ASCII bytes; must use `xxd`, `cp`, or `scp`
- Final Step: Logged into level10 successfully using the decoded password
